## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 164 | 5,000 | 4,836 | +14/week (W30 pace: +2.0/day) | ~10 years at W30 pace |
| Engagement Rate | 4.1% | >1% | Met | Stable | Achieved |
| Premium | ACTIVE (Day 237) | Active | Done | Since 2026-03-01 | - |
| Followers/Post | 0.115 | Track | Declining | W24=0.22, W27=0.15, W28=0.12, W29=0.115 | Content saturation |

## Queue Status (VERIFIED 2026-07-10 — filesystem, S1723)
| Platform | Count | Limit | Status |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| X | 13 | <15 | SpendCapReached (until 2026-07-12). Queue SAFE (files preserved by QuotaExceededError). Zero X content. |
| Bluesky | 7 | <10 | BS drained 5→7 this session (wrote P3+P4 standalones). X outage corollary: BS=7 → STOP. |

Queue pillar composition (X: 13 files — no change, SpendCap):
- BIP: 2/13 = 15%
- P1: 1/13 = 8%
- P2: 3/13 = 23%
- P3: 4/13 = 31% — QUEUE-BLOCKED (≥30%)
- P4: 3/13 = 23%
Note: X blocked until July 12 (SpendCap reset). B125 gate: X≤6 AND P3<30% required after reset.

## X Outage Tracker (active until 2026-07-12 reset)
- BS standalones total: 10
- BIP count: 2
- Posts since last BIP: 4  ← **HARD RULE: Next BS post MUST be BIP. No exceptions.**
- BS pillar distribution: BIP=2(20%), P1=2(20%), P2=2(20%), P3=2(20%), P4=2(20%)
- Outage start: 2026-07-09 (SpendCapReached confirmed in process-outputs run)
- Expected reset: 2026-07-12 (billing cycle reset per API error message)

## B124 Burst (COMPLETE — 10/10 X posts)
- B124 COMPLETE: BIP=3(30%), P1=2(20%), P2=2(20%), P3=2(20%), P4=1(10%) — P4 underweight (10%, target 15-20%).
- Note for B125: front-load P4 at post 2. P3 queue-blocked — pre-burst gate: wait for P3<30%.

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT (S1725)**: Check BS filesystem — if BS drained to ≤6, write BIP BS standalone (posts since BIP=4 → HARD RULE). If still BS=7: accept no PR (Tier 1 exhausted in same burst, pre-retro current).
2. **THEN (July 12)**: Check if X SpendCap reset. If reset: verify filesystem X queue, check P3 composition (P3=31% — need drain to <30%). If X≤6 AND P3<30%: start B125. Slots: BIP(1), P4(2), P2(3), P3(4), P1(5).
3. **AFTER (B125+)**: Continue B125. Back-half checks fire at posts 7-8 (BIP>P3>P4>P1>P2 priority). BS companions when BS≤6.

## Completed This Session (S1724)
- X=13 (SpendCap) — zero X content.
- BS=7 (outage corollary) — zero BS content.
- Dual-blocked. Tier 2: pre-retro updated (S1723 session notes, BS standalones 8→10, P3=2/P4=2 distribution, posts since BIP=4, BIP next rule noted). PRs covered updated to #3635.

## Metrics Delta (S1724)
| Metric | Before | After | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Followers | 164 | 164 | 0 | X metrics unavailable this session |
| X queue | 13 | 13 | 0 | SpendCap blocked — no change |
| BS queue | 7 | 7 | 0 | Outage corollary — no new content |
| BS standalones | 10 | 10 | 0 | No new posts this session |

## Active Hypotheses
- Communities = 30,000x -> NOT YET TESTED (239 days). CRITICAL blocker.
- BIP 3-rule system -> CONFIRMED. B121=30%, B122=30%, B124=30%. System working.
- displacement_flag system -> CONFIRMED (multiple bursts). B124 displacement_flag resolved correctly.
- Content saturation -> CONFIRMED TREND. Followers/post: 0.22->0.15->0.12->0.115.

## Blockers
1. **Communities (CRITICAL)**: Owner must join x.com/i/communities. 239+ days overdue.
2. **Goal deadline**: August 1, 2026 (22 days). At W30 pace (+1.8/day): ~+40 more → ~205 total. Unreachable without Communities. Interim target: 200 followers by Aug 1.
3. **X SpendCap**: Blocked until 2026-07-12. All X queue files preserved (QuotaExceededError behavior). BS standalone mode active.
4. **P3 queue-blocked**: P3=31% (4/13). Need P3<30% (≤3/13) before next P3 X post.

## Session Retrospective (S1724)
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned (S1723): BS=7 (dual-blocked). BIP MUST be next BS post (posts since BIP=4). Tier 1/2 work.
- Actual: Dual-blocked (X=SpendCap, BS=7 outage corollary). Tier 2: pre-retro updated with S1723 session notes. BS standalones tracker updated to 10 posts (even 5-way 20% distribution). BIP next rule documented.
- Delta: As expected. No content possible. Pre-retro is now current through S1723.

### What worked?
- Pre-retro update captured S1723 P3+P4 standalone data before retro.
- BS outage tracker now fully current (10 standalones, perfect 5-way balance, posts since BIP=4).

### What to improve?
- S1725: Check if BS has drained to ≤6. If yes: BIP MUST be next BS standalone. If still BS=7: check if Tier 1 options newly available (if not, accept no PR).
